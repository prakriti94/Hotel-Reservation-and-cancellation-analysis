# Hotel-Reservation-and-cancellation-analysis
To create this dashboard, I leveraged a variety of data sources. These sources included data collected from google, such as reservation and booking records, cancellation. This also provide comprehensive insights and data-driven decision-making capabilities for hotel management and stakeholders. 


Data Preparation:
The data preparation phase was a crucial step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the insights provided by the dashboard. 
This process involved data cleaning to remove duplicate or erroneous records, data transformation to create consistent and structured datasets,
and calculations for metrics like RevPAR and ADR. By thoroughly preparing the data, we ensured that the dashboard delivered accurate and relevant information.

Key Metrics and KPIs:
The dashboard is equipped with key performance indicators and metrics vital to the hotel industry.
These include occupancy rates, revenue figures, ADR (Average Daily Rate), RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), customer satisfaction scores, and more.
These metrics are essential for tracking the hotel's financial health and the quality of the guest experience.

Dashboard Components:

Visualizations: The dashboard features a range of visualizations, carefully selected to best represent the data. For example, we use bar charts to display revenue trends over time, 
heat maps to show room occupancy, and pie charts to analyze the composition of revenue sources.
Filters: To enable users to gain specific insights, we incorporated filters for date ranges, regions, and other relevant criteria.
Drill-throughs: The dashboard allows users to drill down into the data, examining specific details about bookings, room types, and guest profiles.

User-Friendly Design:
The dashboard is designed with the end user in mind. The layout and color scheme were chosen to enhance the user experience and facilitate data interpretation.
Custom tooltips and labels are used to provide clear and concise information.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the hotel analysis dashboard in Power BI is an invaluable tool for hotel management and stakeholders. It empowers them with the ability to make data-driven decisions, 
monitor the hotel's performance, and enhance the overall guest experience. 
This project represents a significant step towards harnessing the power of data for the benefit of the hotel industry, providing a competitive edge and fostering continuous improvement.
